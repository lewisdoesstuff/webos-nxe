# Native Home button hook

LG-XMB's `home-hook.c` is GPL-3.0-only. Its LG input structures, hook targets,
and ezinject entry points are adapted from
[sundermann/inputhookpp](https://github.com/sundermann/inputhookpp/tree/9dc3cf140cb1ae1dbe059525c72710deea7ecf7d),
which is GPL-3.0. The inputhookpp license is included in `licenses/`.

This is a modified implementation. It handles Home only and sends presses to
LG-XMB's root helper. It does not include inputhookpp's configuration watcher,
arbitrary key remapping, or shell command launcher.

The injector is built from
[smx-smx/ezinject at 607055c](https://github.com/smx-smx/ezinject/tree/607055c06b037eadc3992008940d99bdc4a14f53)
by Stefano Moioli, under the zlib license. That source is unchanged. The build
enables position-independent code for its runtime objects. Its license is
included as `licenses/ezinject.txt`.

The hook statically links these libraries supplied by the pinned SDK:

The LGPL-2.1 text also supplies the GNU library license referenced by Frida's
wxWindows notice, under its permission to use version 2 or any later version.

The SDK is built from
[sundermann/buildroot-nc4 at 93adce88](https://github.com/sundermann/buildroot-nc4/tree/93adce888212c31ff2a89f5ea9260961c64fc6c5)
using `lgtv_defconfig`. That tree contains the dependency source locations,
versions, patches and build recipes. `dependencies.json` pins the downloaded SDK
archive by SHA-256. `build-home-hook.sh` builds the injector and hook from
source with that SDK; the resulting `prebuilt/build.json` records the source and
binary hashes. The build files and linked dependency sources above allow the
hook to be rebuilt and relinked with modified libraries.

The TV's standard C/POSIX runtime libraries are dynamically linked and are not
bundled here. No binaries from the Syspoke or unofficial LG Input Hook IPKs are
used.

The source in this directory (`home-hook.c`, `test-home-hook.c`, `CMakeLists.txt`,
`dependencies.json`, `build-home-hook.sh`) is the source of the prebuilt
binaries. The hashes in `prebuilt/build.json` are of the files as they were in the
LG-XMB project, where the script lived at `tools/build-home-hook.sh` and the rest
under `tv-helper/native/`. Only the paths in the script differ here, so a rebuild
writes a new build id and new hashes.
